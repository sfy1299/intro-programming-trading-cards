            >Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a
            cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the
            head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern sharks
            are classified within the clade Selachimorpha and are the sister group
            to the rays.</em

          They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus
          perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres (6.7 in) in length,
          to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the world,
          which reaches approximately 12 metres (40 ft) in length.[3] Sharks are
          found in all seas and are common to depths of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft).
          They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known
          exceptions, such as the bull shark and the river shark, which can be
          found in both seawater and freshwater.[4] Sharks have a covering of
          dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in
          addition to improving their fluid dynamics. They have numerous sets of
          replaceable teeth.[5]

          Well-known species such as the tiger shark, blue shark, great white
          shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark are apex
          predatorsâ€”organisms at the top of their underwater food chain. Many
          shark populations are threatened by human activities.
